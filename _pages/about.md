I am a senior at Michigan State University, double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics with a Biomedical Engineering concentration. I also have a minor in Computational Modeling and Data Science (CMSE).  

My research interests include signal processing, inverse problems, and optimization. I’m excited about making biomedical imaging more accurate and accessible.
