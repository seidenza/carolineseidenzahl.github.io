I am an Honors student at Michigan State University studying Electrical Engineering and Mathematics with a concentration in Biomedical Engineering, and a minor in Computational Modeling and Data Science (CMSE). My research interests include signal processing, inverse problems, and optimization. I am excited about making biomedical imaging more accurate and accessible. 

I am a research assistant in the [Regenerative Electrode Interface Lab](https://reil.iq.msu.edu) under Dr. Erin Purcell, where I study how implanted microelectrodes interact with brain tissue.

I am currently exploring PhD programs in areas related to signal processing, applied mathematics, and biomedical engineering.
